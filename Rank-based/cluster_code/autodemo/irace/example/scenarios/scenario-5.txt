## Scenario setup for Iterated Race (iRace).
############################################################################
## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
parameterFile = "../grammars/sq-grammar.txt"

#File that contains the options for parameter dependencies
dependencyFile = "../grammars/sq-depend-config.txt"

## Directory where the programs will be run.
execDir = "../results-folder"

## Directory where tuning instances are located, either absolute path or
## relative to current directory.
trainInstancesDir = "../mission-folder"

#The maximum total budget for the runs of targetRunner
maxExperiments = 200000

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits = 2

## Specifies how many instances are evaluated before the first elimination
## test.
firstTest = 10

## Specifies how many instances are evaluated between elimination tests
eachTest = 2

## Number of new instances added to each race before evaluating instances from
## previous races
elitistNewInstances = 10

## Enable/disable the sampling of the training instances. If the option
## sampleInstances is disabled, the instances are used in the order provided in the
## trainInstancesFile or in the order they are read from the trainInstancesDir
## when trainInstancesFile is not provided.
sampleInstances = 0

## File with all instances
trainInstancesFile = "../mission-folder/instances-list-5.txt"

#Enable/disable deterministic target algorithm mode. If the target algorithm 
#is deterministic,configurations will be evaluated only once per instance.
#This setting should only be used for target algorithms that do not have a 
#stochastic behavior and, therefore, executing the target algorithm on the 
#same instance several times with different seeds does not make sense.
